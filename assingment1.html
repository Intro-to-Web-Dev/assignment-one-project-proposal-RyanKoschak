<site>One site I would like to model is www.calyxt.com I chose this site because it is easy to follow. It is colorful with lots of pictures to grab your attention. I also like the drop down tabs across the top of the page to easily find what you are looking for people to read. </site>

<p>The number of websites I will have on my individual website is 1. Here's the link: <a>www.calyxt.com</a><p>
    <P>Content: My story: on this page, I will tell my story of my time wearing a brace for scoliosis. I will describe all the details from start to finish. What is Scoliosis: It is when your spinal cord is at a degree of 40 degrees or worse that you need a brace for. 50 degrees or worse and you need back surgery.</P>
    <P>How to get used to wearing a brace and going through it: It took me a few nights to get used to it and then I wore my brace all day except to take a shower and then I just got done with wearing it because I stopped growing. </P>
    <p>Target audience: The main target audience would be kids and teens who are recently diagonised with scoliosis bad enough that they need to start wearing a spinal brace. They may be nervous and anxious, and I hope to help them feel better and more confident about it. The audience could also be parents trying to help their kids through the process too. The audience would seek comfort in knowing they are not alone in this process, and advice on how to make everything easier.</p>
